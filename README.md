## What I Build

**Production ML Systems**
- End-to-end NLP pipelines processing millions of documents with sub-second inference
- Multi-tenant RAG architectures with semantic caching and vector optimization
- MLOps automation reducing model deployment time from weeks to hours

**Infrastructure & Scale**
- Azure ML pipelines orchestrating distributed training across GPU clusters
- Docker-based serving infrastructure handling 10K+ daily requests with <100ms p95 latency
- Real-time monitoring and model drift detection systems

**Technical Depth**
- LLM fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA) for summarization, classification, and domain adaptation
- Transformer architectures (BERT, GPT, T5) optimized for production constraints
- Distributed training with mixed precision and gradient accumulation
